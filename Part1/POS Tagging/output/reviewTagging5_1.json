I met the husband and wife owners and they seemed like really nice people that care about their customers. The Wok Box is a Canadian based Franchisor. This is the second Franchise to open in the US.\n\nMy wife ordered this noodle bowl that we shared and I ordered some spring rolls which were served with plum sauce. The noodle bowl was delicious. The eggrolls came out  a little frozen the first time around. But that was quickly rectified by the owners. I really enjoyed the plum sauce as opposed to the omnipresent orange sauce.\n\nThey have a couple of kinks to work out. But the place was comfortable and inviting with a self serve soda machine. They have a lot of different entrees from all over Asia; This includes asian po'boy sandwiches. They are a couple of bucks more than the chinese restaurant we normally go to but it's a nice change of pace. It's always good to have options.
