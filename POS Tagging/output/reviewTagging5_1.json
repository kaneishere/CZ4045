My co-workers often pick up pretzels from here for birthdays or other office events, and everyone spends the morning raving about how delicious the pretzels are and how they cannot stop eating them. Am I missing something? I just sit quietly at my desk and raise an eyebrow at all this chatter. I've had them at least 5-8 times and cannot say that I've ever enjoyed them. The regular pretzels are either over or under salted (not sure if that is a preference the customer can select or if it's just random), and the cinnamon sugar just taste strange. They often taste very soggy, too, like they were bagged when still too warm. Occasionally, co-workers pick-up the \"cheese\" sauce. This stuff looks like a melted yellow crayon. I love all types of cheese, but this looks and tastes terrible.
