# Word-level language modeling FNN

**Third party libraries**

python >= 3.8

torch == 1.9.0

**Running the files**\
Since the main code is in jupyter notebook format, they are ready to be run if the relevant packages are installed correctly in the environment and data paths are followed correctly.

Run the FNNMain.ipynb

**Explanation of output**\
The training is expected to run 15 epochs of results, displaying the loss, accuracy and perplexity of the model.

The same applies to the model with weight tying.

The results are plotted to have a better visualisation.

The text generated can be found in the "generated.txt" file.
