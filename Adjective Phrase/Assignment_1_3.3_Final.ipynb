Bonus!\", \"Was blown away by service - which isn't a small feat when you were just picking up food! \\nDeep dish, NY style pizza just loaded with cheese.\\nPizza is delicious, ingredients are fresh and it really is heads and shoulders above your every day delivery.\\n\\nThe only downside for me, and it was a complete personal taste thing, is that I don't like that much cheese on my pizza and prefer slightly thinner crust. \\n\\nYes, expecting your total outrage at the above comment!! :P\", 'I ordered a meat lovers pizza and it was really good. The pizza has a generous amount of tasty toppings and cheese with the right amount of sauce. The dough is light,soft and crispy around the edges. I will definitely come back for more pizza.', \"Fantastic pizza, altho they cover the toppings in cheese which I don't prefer, but it's not a big issue. We live around the corner so it's convenient for pickup, we haven't used the delivery service. It's pricier tho, so we don't order here often. Great pizza, the wings are good, if you show up too early and have a long wait they serve beer. Thumbs up.\", \"Twice in one week. Spivak!!! And a cold Canadian draft with the wife and her veggie with feta\\n\\nHit by a cheese tsunami and superb service. Highly recommend Pinos. Yes, hard to see from road but Ajax's hidden gem.\\n\\nHaving Pinos pesto pizza and Spivak special. Tell you more after we eat.\", \"Love love love this place- one of the best pizzas I've ever had, great prices, so freaking good. LOVE the toppings and the mountain of cheese. YUM.\", 'So good! I miss this place. I use to go all the time when I was younger and danced at the nearby dance studio.', 'So, here is my story.  My family and I were visiting from Boston, MA.\\n\\nAfter driving 5 hours from Montreal, we immediately dropped our stuff off at the Airbnb we were staying and went to the Zoo.\\n\\nIt was 7:30pm and we were tired and hungry.  We wanted something fast and decided to order pizza for pick up on our way \"home\".\\n\\nSo, we order 2 large pizzas which came out to about $50 (expensive!)\\n\\nDrive was about 20 mins from the zoo and they told us 25 mins. So, perfect timing.\\n\\nWe get there and my dad goes in to pay and pick it up. they had not made our pizzas.  The lady at the counter told us, she thought it was a prank call and did not put the order it.  So, we had to wait a half hour longer for our pizzas.  Out number had come up on the caller ID and after we had told her we were visiting for the weekend.\\n\\nWe are all a little hangry at this point.  so, basically 1.5 hours later our pizzas were ready.\\n\\nThe pizza was rather disappointing as well.  Just too much and heavy slices.\\n\\nNote to visitors: call from a local number if you want pick up.  Now i am not sure if they would have delivered had we called.', 'Sweet Jesus, Pizza Pino is ahhhmazing!\\n\\nMy review is for a take-out order, so this is more about the food- not so much the service. \\n\\nFirst off, I ordered on a Friday night for a party of 4 and they were pretty prompt in getting our order ready. The price was also very good for what you get.\\n\\nSo, we unboxed the pizza at a friend\\'s house and this was my first Pizza Pino experience. Everyone was hyping about it and they compared the pizza to a lasagna. I was beyond excited when I heard this. I got my first slice and there were just toppings coming out of the piece of pizza. I had a veggie slice so there were green peppers, mushrooms, onions, and tomatoes... and a massive bed of cheese. I bit into it and it was just great. One this that I didn\\'t like were the tomatoes. They were just a bit too \"crunchy\" for a piece of pizza. I thought the tomatoes would\\'ve cooked through a bit more than I thought. Other than that, it was just really good pizza.\\n\\nI couldn\\'t eat more than 2 slices because it was just that packed. I\\'d really give this place a try if you\\'re in the mood for a \"deep dish\".... the dish is pretty deep on this one!', 'Had their pizza a couple of times and the toppings are ridiculous. \\nLittle bit higher than other places', \"Love this place!!! \\n\\nTheir cheese is amazing and they really pile on the toppings so if you're not used to it or it's not your thing then try to be minimal with your topping selection.   I learned not to order ground beef on my pizza because it's just too much but I really enjoy a simple pizza from them because the ingredients are fresh and tasty. \\n\\nThe colonel's pizza (ranch dressing instead of sauce with strips of chicken .. ) is really an amazing pizza,. Once I accidentally received this pizza as mine was mixed up with another person's order but I gotta say it was amazing and I never would have ordered something like this myself, so thank you!\", 'If you like thick hardy pizza towered with toppings this is the place for you! Good bang for your buck and some unique topping and sauce choices', \"Great pizza .. very filling quick service ... I always order these guys through the Livery and I must say there is not one person in my home that has not complemented pizza. Each piece of sliced must weigh at least 5 lb LOL you definitely get your money's worth from this establishment the very courteous and timely I have never had an issue with it and I know numerous people that order from this company and they are fabulous.\", 'Disclaimer - I came here for dinner on Labour Day, so this review is based on a restaurant that was very likely understaffed. \\n\\nThis place was close to the waterfront park so my boyfriend and I thought it would be a good idea to try out the thick crust that has gotten great reviews. Here\\'s my take:\\n\\nService (1/5): 1 of the 2 main reasons why I wouldn\\'t come back. I knew we had to wait \"longer\" than usual, but good service would have warned us that we\\'d have to wait around 1 hour for food... We waited 50 minutes for pizza, 55 minutes for poutine. Sure our waitress was kind, and we were thanked for our patience, but it was too late at that point. We just wanted to get something in our stomach and leave.\\n\\nLarge Pino Special + Poutine (1.5/5): The 2nd reason why I wouldn\\'t come back. You can read every other review about how cheesy and full of ingredients the pizza was. How the crust was great and overall for a mom and pop shop they did make good pizza... but that won\\'t make up for the food poisoning my boyfriend and I paid for after the fact. We both thought it was something else, but after I brought home left overs for my family they also had to use the bathroom to get rid of what they ate. I figure it was because Pino\\'s was understaffed and with an influx of orders they rushed and did not cook the pizza well enough. The Poutine was pretty standard, nothing much to say there. \\n\\nCost (3/5): $20 for a large pizza and $7 for poutine + tip. Not bad. It\\'s not a chain, the servings were large and hearty, so I think it was fairly priced.\\n\\nAmbiance (3/5): It\\'s a mom and pop shop! Don\\'t expect anything fancy. However it\\'s family friendly and clean. Can\\'t really ask for more than that.\\n\\nOverall, besides some kind of food poisoning and horrendous wait time, the pizza wasn\\'t that special. it was a nice change from chains like pizza pizza and pizza hut, but not special enough to come back for a second round. Sorry Pino\\'s.', \"Ever since moving to Toronto 16 years ago, and more recently Whitby 12 years ago finding good pizza has been a challenge. Tired of all the franchise brands poor excuse for pizza. We stumbled across this place while searching Yelp. A couple photos of their pizza looked great, and got me excited. So we made the drive to South Ajax to give them a try. While it wasn't the Cornwall pizza I grew up with. It was it's own.. great sauce, fresh toppings and it was very good overall. My daughter had a XS cheese pizza for like $5.31 (so cheap), and my wife and I split a Med (half Pino Special, half Meat Lovers). I was very pleasantly surprised. Very generous on the toppings, including cheese. We will most certainly be back, and want to try other menu items. They had a large number of specialty pizzas.  Want to try their meat sauce base next time. Their location is not really something you will stumble across, so Yelp was a big help to draw us there. The restaurant while clean, is basic and somewhat dated. They were fairly busy for sit down service, but very busy for pick up / take out service. Looking forward to our next visit already.\", \"I needed to update my rating.  During takeout I really just focus on the food quality and taste.  I ordered a large 3 topping with wings special and I was so disappointed they didn't even start making my wings until I got there 30+ minutes later.  they had me and my pizza (now cold) sit for 20 minutes for he wings.  I didn't drive out there to get a very cold pizza; it is really unacceptable they didn't have the wings started when while there was traffic they were not busy.    When I got home they actually put too much cheese on (and I LOVE cheese) so much so the pizza didn't cook properly and the brick of cheese on top fell off when u try to eat it and topping were cold.   The mistake was so bad I really can't justify going out there if they can't serve hot food or get a simple order ready in reasonable time.   I won't be back\", 'Good pizza  bit slow pick up service... good old pizza made almost Montreal style never had a bad pizza from there been around forever delivery service is reliable decent sized menu. Staff were friendly enough very busy kitchen no time to really chat with customers', \"This is such a hidden gem. The pizza I had was veggie and it was amazing. It's how pizza should always taste. The crust was perfect and the amount of toppings you get is worth the money. Even that, the price wasn't too bad. Overall a really nice place.\", \"I absolutely love this place. My go to joint for a special night of pizza. I have definitely made a trip out to Ajax just to get my hands on their calzones and to introduce others to this joint. The place doesn't look very posh from the outside so a city folk may be hesitant to walk in. The location is a bit odd but since I was introduced to it by a local, I've been introducing it to plenty of other people who don't even live in the area. I suggest giving their pizzas and calzones a try. But don't eat with your eyes! Their portions are BIG! I typically cannot finish off a personal calzone and if I do, I'm out cold afterwards.\", 'Best pizza I have ever had in the whole of GTA.... Their crust is soft and the pizza is rich and flavorful... Their cheese is very rich and each pizza is unique', \"My husband and I moved to Toronto about 4 years ago and were struggling to find even a decent pizza place. We stumbled upon Pino Pizza last month when my in-laws were visiting and we were in Oshawa. We yelp'd it and took a chance. No looking back! The pizza is awesome, portions amazing and just overall amazing! It's so unassuming when you see it (it's kind of hidden). I can call it a hidden gem!\", 'Just had the Pizza Pino Special but asked for thin crust.  My new favourite thing you gotta try it', 'Ordered for pick up on a Wednesday night after work.  Our order was ready on time and was waiting when we arrived.  We ordered a large 3 topping pizza.  Pepperoni, mushrooms and sausage.  The pizza was loaded with toppings under the cheese.  The cheese was plentiful and honestly a bit too much for my liking.  I am also not a huge fan of toppings under the cheese.  The crust was also a bit too thick for my taste.  Overall,  it was decent pizza but a bit pricey.  Just not quite what we are used to.  May go back to try their other dishes at some point.', \"Best pizza ever (well, in the GTA anyway).\\nGreat crust, sauce, and toppings. \\n\\nGreat for takeout. We don't live in Ajax, so delivery is unfortunately not an option.\\n\\nEat in is ok- atmosphere is like a small town diner without boothes -  but you go here for the pizza, not the decor. The pizza more than offsets it though. \\n\\nHighly recommend it.\", 'My friend and I stopped to have some good food.  We were not let down.  I had a panzerotti and my friend had spaghetti and meatballs. We also split an order of garlic bread with cheese.  I could only eat a third of it as it was HUGE.  The garlic bread was seasoned just right and had a pile of cheese on it.  Her spaghetti sauce was meaty and full of meatballs.  Definitely will be back again soon!!!', \"I have had Pizza Pino three times so far, and it's really amazing. One time, I ordered a Large and shared it with one other friend, we finally ended up finishing it within a week! (Meat Lover).\\n\\nThere are a LOT of cheese on there, so if you're a cheese lover, this is definitely your kind of pizza! I used to add extra cheese on my pizza everywhere else, but the regular Pino's cheese was a good amount for me already.\\n\\nI would definitely recommend this for big groups, smaller groups (for two people etc.) maybe a small/medium would do.\\n\\nHighly recommend.\", \"Great pizza. Love the mounds of cheese piled on top. Had the Meat Lovers and Pino Special. Loved them both.\\nHave also tried the calzones. I was feeling adventurous and got The Monster. The thing was  ridiculously big! Only got through about a quarter of it. It was good...not great. \\nLastly, I also tried the wings. Now these, I was pleasantly surprised with! When I got the wings and noticed they weren't breaded, I didn't expect much. To my surprise, they were awesome! Nice size and very yummy. They tasted like actual chicken!\\nPizza Pinos really is a hidden gem.\", \"I just went to pizza Pinots tonight after hearing about from my many friends and coworkers and all I have to say is it was worth the wait. i've tried all the generic pizza places like Domino's ,Pizza pizza pizza nova, and Pizza Hut. But this pizza  is made with really good ingredients and great cheeses. But most of all the dough is very edible. So if you live around the East end I encourage you to deafly swing by and grab yourself a pizza.\", 'Best pizza around. The Pino special is the best. The medium is enough for 2 people! The decor is very basic, but the staff is friendly and the food is really good.', \"Cancel your order everywhere else. This is the place for pizza. Makes the others taste like microwave pizza. Toppings a plenty and very generous. Great old school restaurant, like travelling back in time. Can't wait to visit again. Also order in all the time. Just as good at home. Great value, great time.\", \"Came out with a few friends for a birthday dinner. First of all the food was phenomenal - I would highly recommend the garlic bread, wings, onion rings, and especially THE PIZZA. What really made this experience amazing however was our waiter. He checked in on us all night, played music that we enjoyed, and even threw in a complimentary dessert (I've attached a photo)! This is what you call service - and for that reason I will be returning to Pizza Pinos.\", 'We really need to call this something besides pizza. It is the most amazing pizza we\\'ve had. \\n\\nWe\\'ve lived in Ajax for 15 years and have only recently discovered this place. The scope of review for us is limited as we\\'ve only had pizza there despite their other items. \\n\\nThe pizza is amazing. The crust is thick BUT very light. We had the 3 meat variety each time with differing choices. Absolutely delicious. \\n\\nThe surroundings are very un-modern, sparse even hut I can\\'t remove star for that as it seems to add to that neighbourhood independent hand made \"pizza place\" we all remember as kids. \\n\\nThe staff are friendly and easy to deal with. \\n\\nIt\\'s about 30 bucks for a 3 topping XL and it takes about 30 minutes to get it. It\\'s very thick with enough cheese that you\\'ll never want to order extra. The filling is thick, the sauce home made and tasty buy not dominant. \\n\\nIt\\'s been an excellent and consistent experience every time. None of us can imagine ever eating a chain pizza again.', \"The pizza is delicious. Very cheesy & thick, so don't get thick crust or extra cheese. You will probably need a fork and knife to eat it. The cinnamon balls are really good too, you have to get them!\", \"Four-and-a-half. ****'\\n\\nWhat a glorious pie. I only tried two varieties of pizza here and have not explored other menu options. But wow do I wish I had this in college on those nights where a bunch of us were seized with a case of drunken-haze munchies. This would have definitely hit the spot.\\n\\nI had two slice of their small delivered to a friend's house. I enjoyed it so much it warranted an order of their namesake special in the medium the very next day. The crust is on the thin side, but is sturdy and does not fold. It has a nice texture with a good balance of give and a bit of crunch, able to support the toppings. Sauce is well immersed into the pie, without squirting or bleeding out on a bite and without the offending tartness of sauces on pizzas of lesser joints. But the CHEESE. If you don't like cheese, don't bother coming here. I suspect---but I could be wrong--- that there are two layers of cheese: one thin one to anneal the toppings to the pie and another thicker wave that is in direct exposure to the oven heat (leading to spots of caramelized cheese at the topmost layer). The result? A wonderful pie layered in both texture and flavour leading to a more dimensional mouthfeel. Really my only gripe with this pizza is the pepperoni--- I'm a sucker for curled in crispy pepperoni and that can only happen if the pepperoni is at the very top layer. Otherwise, Pizza Pino comes highly recommended.\", 'Always our go to Pizza place in Ajax, love the Pono Special, so much cheese and very filling!', \"Looking for REAL pizza? This is DEFINITELY the place!!! The pizzas are loaded with toppings and cooked to perfection. The wings are perfectly crispy and big. And don't ever forget to order the Pino sticks! Every bite is heavenly.\", \"I decided to try a pizza place that I have heard, time and time again, is the best in Durham Region.  I have had amazing pizza in Little Italy in downtown Toronto and this is not that. However, if you compare the quality of this pizza to the chains available in Durham this place wins hands down. The regular crust is halfway between regular and deep dish. I am a crust and dough lover so it really appealed to me. The flavor of the dough was also great and not overpowered by the rest of the pizza. It was crisp around the edges and bottom and had a great soft chew throughout the rest.  The cheese could be a bit better quality but you can't argue with the amount that they put on. The toppings were also used in good amounts. I had the personal size XS which was under $10 with 3 toppings.  I ate the whole thing and I was STUFFED. The decor is very dated but I personally think that only adds to experience. Add 10 Bikers or 10 Brooklyn accented Italians and you would think that money is being laundered in the back room behind the drapes. Definitely going back here. Not the best pizza I have ever had BUT definitely the best pizza in Durham.\", 'After much anticipation, we finally had a chance to sample what other Yelpers voted as \"the best pizza in Durham region.\"  As much as I value fellow Yelper\\'s opinions, I was still skeptical coming from some disagreeable experiences from previous Yelp recommendations.  \\n\\nWe drove into this very nondescript plaza on a lazy Saturday afternoon looking for lunch.  We were greeted and seated promptly by a very efficient young server who was also our pizza maker.  Since it was our first time, we decided to stick to something \"safe\" like a medium size pizza (Pino Special, I think) and a Caesar salad to share between the two of us.  \\n\\nWhat first came out was a huge mound of over-dressed romaine in store bought dressing with a very generous amount of house-made croutons and enough bacon bits (the real thing) to clog a grown man\\'s artery!   To be fair, I have to mention that we were given an option of receiving our salad tossed or with the dressing on the side.  And since we opted for the salad to be tossed in the kitchen, we can\\'t really complain about the dressing overload part.  But let me just say that my husband is a real bacon lover and even he proceeded to push extra bacon bits he couldn\\'t consume to the side of his plate which by the end of our belly-busting meal, created a small tower.  The salad was so huge that by the time our pizza arrived, we were already pretty full.  \\n\\nAnd then the behemoth of a pizza was placed on our table.....and we just looked at each other and burst into laughter at the thickness of this thing.  We had read numerous reviews about pizza pino\\'s pizza being thick crust but seriously....this was like having two regular pizzas (like what you\\'ll get from pizza pizza) stacked on top of each other.  Again, not necessarily a bad thing for those wanting a hefty meal but for us, it was supposed to be lunch.  \\n\\nOur pizza was LOADED with pepperoni slices, mushrooms, even more bacon bits, I think there were some green peppers and soooooooooo much cheese.  I can\\'t even begin to describe what this thing looked like.  (please refer to the photos)  I had ONE slice and could not dare grab another one.  My stout hubby had impressive TWO slices.  The shock of the thickness aside, the pizza was tasty.  How could it not be with that much goodness???  It\\'s just a shame that we were so full from our salad.  We packed up the rest (more than half of the medium pizza) for dinner.  We ended up eating the leftovers over 2 meals!\\n\\nNow, the million dollar question is, would I return to Pizza Pino.  I think I might....that is if I could recruit enough heavy eaters to justify ordering a pizza that big (or that thick).', \"We finally tried this place after wanting to for a long time! We were not disappointed. Friendly staff. It's not in the best location as it is out of the way, but the pizza is delicious! I love a pizza with the perfect ratio of cheese, dough and toppings and they definitely had that. We had their Spivak special with pepperoni, bacon, sausage and pineapple. Their small size looked like a medium-sized pizza!\\nWhile you wait for your pizza, you can have a beer on draught or any other alcoholic beverage since they are licensed to serve alcohol.\", \"Great pizza!! I order the Meat Lovers and the Pino special.... I recommend the Pino special.   Pizzas were cooked nicely and had the right amount of toppings.   The Pizzas were very filling.   I'm off to try the monster panz....will write a review about it\", \"A unique pizza experience!\\n\\nI love dining in retro places, particularly the retro places which are kept clean and this is one of those.\\n\\nYou would walk in and first thing you would notice is that they have classical 70-80s songs playing, you walk a little further and see that all the walls in this place are occupied by photos of historical Ajax. Since I have literally moved to Ajax 2 days ago, i got to learn a lot about Ajax's history through this! cool.\\n\\nWe ordered a deal of 1 medium pizza and 10 wings, added 3 extra toppings to the pizza and the bill just came up to $30, very reasonable!\\n\\nNow the pizza they have is very different than your normal day to day pizza, they do thick crusts, but unlike other pizza joints, they aren't stingy with their toppings and cheese. SOOO MUCH CHEESSE! and its high quality too. The grilled chicken on the pizza had flavour as well.\\n\\nThe wings were cooked good and the blue cheese with it went perfectly, but the hot flavour is just frank sauce all over it.\\n\\nWould definitely be coming back here.\\n\\nNote: It does take a little while for them to make the pizza.\", 'Love this pizza shop.  The pies have so much cheese on them and they have a bunch of ingredients on hand to customize.  I wish the price was a little less tho', \"Recently moved into the area and I've already had pizza from here half dozen times. Everyone that I know that I've given pizza to has said they need to open more locations. \\n\\nThe pizza reminds me of deep dish pizza. It's not too doughy like Pizza Pizza pizza but not too thin. It's just right! Having the cheese on top is genius! The toppings won't slide off like other places.\\n\\nThe wings are also very good. Not too small or big with a good amount of meat on them. The recommendation of honey garlic and hot sauce was one of the best flavours I've had.\\n\\nStaff is always courteous and efficient. Only thing I can complain about is that the pizza can't come fast enough!! I need it now!!! Sooooooo good and worth the wait!\", 'Great food! Great staff!\\n\\nWalking into the restaurant, felt like a small town lounge spot, with a couple dozen people talking, and playing cards.\\n\\nI was reading through yelp reviews before deciding to drive to Ajax from Scarborough for pizza and i saw a photo with the comment: \"two adults could not even finish a medium 10\" pizza\". Being skeptical, and very hungry i decided to try this place out with a friend.\\n\\nSpecial: large 1 toping for just under $11.\\n\\nThat pizza was split between two hungry 20 year old guys.

After eating this pizza i was stuffed, the toppings are generous.\\n\\nThis place is good for takeout, i personally would not want dine there as the place is kinda suspect. I felt like i was transported back to an old 80's bar.\\n\\nBut to each his own :)\", 'After reading the reviews, we decided to come here for our first dinner after arriving in Canada. We ordered the small veggie pizza which was pretty good. It was very doughy and kind of reminded me of Pizza Hut pizza. We also ordered the pasta with meat sauce and mushrooms and liked it. This dish brought back memories of my dad.  :). We also ordered poutines which were ok. The french fries w Service was very friendly. Glad we stopped by!', 'This is the best pizza I have had between markham and oshawa. It has a crispy bottom and soft dough with lots of topping. My boyfriend and I split a medium and still have almost half a pizza left over. We will be coming back. Great server too.', \"This is a great little spot. The price is similar to that of big chains, like Dominos and Pizza Hut but the quality of the ingredients and that thick crust homemade goodness can't be beat. The service was good, definitely not the greatest I've ever encountered but they get the job done. We ordered pizza, wings and drinks. Excellent pizza and passable wings. This place is a little bit off the beaten track and isn't somewhere I'd necessarily go out of my way to find again. \\n\\nCheck it out if you're around. You won't regret it.\", \"Thick slices with amazing sauce and tons of cheese. Salads are fresh and plentiful. They do lots of take out business for the locals.

They do the thick crust with generous toppings style well, but if you prefer thinner crust and more modest amounts of cheese, specify that when you order.\\n\\nWhat I liked: dough was well cooked although it was thick; toppings were generous.\\n\\nWhat I didn\\'t like: personal taste again, but the sauce is a specific brand used at some pizza places that has a bitterness to it, and they\\'re a bit heavy-handed for my liking; their usual amount of cheese is A LOT of cheese, so it doesn\\'t melt into the other toppings but instead kinda lays on top like a stretchy blanket. Overall it\\'s just too heavy.\\n\\nI will be back to try thinner crust and all that but in summary, know that you\\'re getting good North American-style pizza here. For anything else, go somewhere else.', 'My brother told me about this place.

I prefer thick crust pizza loaded with lots of toppings, but unfortunately nobody does Chicago style here... Pizza Pino is more like Buffalo style, which is a New York/Chicago hybrid.  Lots of toppings, thick crust.  It\\'s not significantly more expensive than chain pizza but blows them all away in quality. What was really telling is, \"extra\" or \"double\" cheese is not offered as an option. You won\\'t need it....\\n\\nIf you\\'re tired of GTA chain pizza where the sauce and cheese are applied with a spray gun, but are also not a fan of thin crust so-called \"gourmet\" hype with stupid toppings (I hate that CPK-style crap), try Pino\\'s.

I drive from bowmanville on Sundays and am never disappointed.\", \"Don't come to Pizza Pino unless you're famished.

The pizzas are fantastic, and much bigger than their name suggests. Although I only ordered a \"small\" I still took a couple of slices home. Prices are fair for a restaurant, a little higher than typically found at a chain delivery store, but in my opinion are worth it.\\n\\nThe crust is a good balance between being not too thin, nor too thick or stodgy. The sauce and cheese is plenty, and toppings aren\\'t stingily laid.\\n\\nStaff were friendly, not too intrusive, but aware enough of when drinks needed topping up, and to bring take home boxes. I was also grateful that they put a rush on my autistic son\\'s order, as he has a very hard time in restaurants waiting for his food to come out once ordered. The rest of our table\\'s order took a bit of while, but was worth the wait. This was my first visit, but I will certainly be back.', 'This place had really outstanding pizza. we would pay $7 for delivery. Over th,e past six months the delivery has been really bad, pizza cold and salad dressing forgotten. Last night was my last try at it.', \"Service was amazing, without a doubt. We got the large pizza and wings combo with the pino sticks to start. The pino sticks were great and the hot wings were great too. But I am probably the only person on this page who didn't like the pizza. Far too much cheese, crust is way too thick, and we just didn't enjoy it. That being said, my husband had their panzerotti a few weeks ago and loved it. I would go back, but only for the pino sticks or a panzerotti.\", 'Service and food quality has declined drastically.

The staff and delivery driver seem to always be in a good mood. If you like panzerotti's try the Monster :)\", \"One word for this restaurant - CHEESE! And Lots of it! It's a bit pricy for pizza - many other places in the area (eg. chain stores) will have better deals, but not better taste than Pizza Pino!\", \"Pizza Pino has the best Pizza I've found in Durham Region.  You can tell when you bite into it that it's fresh and hand made.  The crust is delicious and the toppings are generous.  The pizza is quite filling so keep that in mind when ordering as you may normally order an extra large from a chain place, you may only need a large from Pizza Pino.  I ordered the wings recently and they were quite good.  Big, Juicy and Saucy.  I was surprised at the quality of the wings as usually from pizza places they aren't very good.   \\n\\nPizza Pino's does take longer to deliver/pickup than chain restaurants but it's well worth it.  Try their walk-in special, it's quite reasonable considering what you get.\", \"Calling all LACTOSE INTOLERANT YELPERS - This is NOT the place for you.\\n\\nIf you love cheese then welcome to Pizza Pino's! \\n\\nI wish this place would do a reno.  It's a complete mess inside - you wouldn't want to stay and eat here.  It belongs on the show restaurant makeover, however don't be fooled - It doesn't reflect the quality of food.\\nOn the website it looks better than what it really is.  They claim they are a sports bar - I beg to differ.   I came in here on a Wednesday night and it was DEAD.  A lot of people preorder and get takeout. \\n\\nI found this place hard to find too, it's tucked away near factory buildings and totally isolated. \\n\\nBack to the food: \\n\\nSo I got the Pino's special which was pepperoni, peppers, mushrooms and I believe bacon? Can't recall now.\\n\\nThis place does their pizza the opposite way - the toppings are hidden under the brick of cheese they use.... seriously we are talking A LOT of cheese. Food is hot and a med size will feed 2 people with a few leftover slices for lunch the next day. \\n\\nStaff are friendly - a lot of their customers are regulars so they say hi and catch up on old convos - kinda of like a family unit in there.\\n\\nIf you ever have a pizza craving in Ajax - Head to Pino's!\", \"Pino's is the only place my family of 10 can agree on for take out.

Server was very nice. However we waited 45 minutes for the pizza to finally arrive.', \"The most flavorful thick crust pizza in the Toronto area by far!!!!\\n\\nI usually like thin crust authentic pizzas. Lombardi's in New York is my all time favorite but this place has reshaped my thoughts on thick crust. Each slice is heavily topped and has the perfect amount of flavor and although the amount of toppings are ridiculous, the crust holds up great. I can't stress enough how tasty these things are. Amazing!\\n\\nIf ever in the Ajax area you MUST pick up a pizza here. Take it home and re-heat it, its still amazing even 2 days after. A must try!\", 'One word: WOW! And not just \"wow\", we\\'re talking \"WOW!\" I wish I could just leave it at that but that probably won\\'t do. Pizza Pino is a treasure that my friends and I came across while visiting another friend in Ajax. They serve pizza, pasta, salad, yummy fried goodness, all the good stuff. You can add a variety of toppings but they have set prices for set toppings, such as the meat lovers, or veggie pizza. Their pizza is similar to Chicago pizza for those who\\'ve tried, but thinner crust.\\n\\nThe thing I love about this place is how fresh their toppings are; the chicken chunks are huge and tender, unlike other franchise pizza joints that have meats as hard as wood. And for the cheese lovers, you don\\'t even have to worry about getting extra cheese because the amount of cheese you get on your pizza is ridiculously thick. Pino definitely does not cheap out on their toppings. \\n\\nWe ordered a large that on their website claimed to feed 3-4 people, but even with four hungry stomachs there were at least a quarter left of the pizza by the end of our feast. I\\'d say a large easily feeds 4-5! I ordered a medium on my own, and that alone was more than enough for my family of four for dinner!\\n\\nIt\\'s pricey though, and that large pizza came up to $40, the medium $20. Granted, we customized our own pizza so it went by a different price. There was also a 45 minute wait on delivery, where it usually takes half the time (or so I\\'m told) so be prepared to wait for your food! Or call in ahead of time. But I definitely recommend this place to anyone who is a pizza lover. \\n\\n10/10 would come again!', 'I\\'m not a fan of thick crust pizza...but I make an exception when it comes to Pizza Pino. \\nThe best pizza ever! Tons of cheese and toppings. I\\'m just drooling thinking about the \"Pino\\'s Special\" right now!!!!', \"Delicious deep dish pizza! We order a small (or Medium if extra hungry) Pino's Special for two of us and ask for it to be well-cooked.\", 'I LOVE this pizza joint and eat here religiously. They load up the toppings and cheese, and its so thick you need a fork and a knife to cut into it. \\n\\nI have not rewarded them another star simply because the service is a hit and miss. One specific waitress here was very condescending when my family attended the place a year and a half ago.', \"Best pizza I've eaten.  Thick,  generous amounts of toppings and cheese.  A tad expensive but definitely worth the price\", \"Ordered from here for the first time after reading the reviews and I must say they hold up well. Some people complained about time service,  but I don't have a single complaint I ordered my pizza and within 1hr it was delivered. Which brings me to another service I'm happy with, I live in Whitby and very surprised they deliver this far and especially with the 1hr ordering and at my door and time frame. \\n\\nAs far as the food goes. I loved the pizza and the pino sticks were not bad nothing super special. I find the pino sticks had too much garlic on the top. Now the pizza was amazing, it wasn't as thick as other pictures posted but maybe that is because I got the garlic based pizza. I had pizza once at chucky cheese and liked how it had a garlic base so when I seen these guys offered it I had to try it out. Definitely awesome and adds more flavor to the pizza while not being over powering the toppings. I just had a 2 cheese and pepporoni and I could still them both. So A+ on the pizza!!!\\n\\nNow it was $30 for a medium pizza and sticks so not too bad and well worth the extra little cost. I will definitely order from them again. I like trying all these one off pizza places they always seem to be better then the big name stores. \\n\\nI'd definitely recommend this place. I give it 4.5/5 but the application will not let me so 5 it is. Just due to the pino stick.\", \"More a 4.5\\nThis is an overall score.\\nWe ordered in, did an xlarge pizza not knowing what we were getting ourselves into lol. Also 2 lbs of bbq wings.

So thats where tge extra stars come off.\\nThe pizza on the other hand.\\nOut of this world, best I've ever had hands down. The crust is perfectly cooked almost as though they have a wood oven. The toppings they do not skimp at all. We almost got extra cheese since most places you have to. Thank god we didnt because it was beautifully dressed. Red onions on the bottom, pepperoni, real bacon and the cheese . So much cheese I was in heaven. One slice is like 3 slices from other pizza joints. So filling and mouth watering. I am from missisauga but let me twll you I am so willing to travel for my new found love. \\nDont second guess just get it!!! *licks lips*\", 'The pizza tastes great and the ingredients are excellent but the service and the restaurant atmosphere are pretty terrible. \\nThe 1st time we went there we waited a very long time and after half an hour we were told they forgot to input our order and we had to wait another half hour for our pizzas.  The 2nd time we went  they brought one pizza and forgot our second order ( sandwich and fries). By the time they realized it , my husband and son were done eating their pizza and i was still starving and just really upset that I wanted to leave (by the way the fries are quite a disappointment) . When we complained they didn\\'t offer any apologies and just said that the kitchen is backed up on \"non-pizza\" orders and they can\\'t manage it so that all orders come to the table at the same time!\\nBoth times the place was very poorly ventilated and smelled like burnt grease.\\nI might consider pick-up in the future  because my family really loved the pizza but I would never go eat there again.', 'I find Pizza Pino somewhat deceptive, they put the cheese on top which covers how few of the other items they actually put on the pizza.', \"Huge pizza, but pretty slim on the toppings I felt.  I came all the way from Oshawa to try this pizza out.\\n\\nPerhaps Friday night was an off night, because the XL Pino Special I got was one slim pizza when it came to toppings.  It was pretty reasonable with the cheese, though, but I think I'll just stick to Beenos in Oshawa.  Same style of pizza but probably double the toppings as Pizza Pino.\", \"Great pizza so much cheese can't ask for any thing more. Got the meat lovers very filling great little hidden gem in Durham recommend next time you decide to order a pizza think of pizza pinos first you won't regret it.\", 'Amazing pizza with lots of toppings and cheese!

The atendente was sympathetic but I felt he could had checked on us during the meal. But overall we had a great meal!', 'We really wanted to try their pizza and wings after reading the good reviews. We had family over for my birthday. We are extremely disappointed with the customer service.  We ordered at 5:30. We were told to expect to get the delivery by about 6:30. They are only about five kilometres away in Ajax.  The delivery guy just arrived at 8. It was an hour and a half late. I had called a few times to follow up. They said the delivery person came but no one answered the door; we live in a small home and we would have heard the door bell loud and clear.  Extremely disappointing. We wanted to support local business and this one generally had good reviews.  Wish they would improve their delivery and customer service.  We just ended up cancelling the order.', 'Always on the lookout for new pizza joints in Durham and decided to try this place out because of the rave reviews.

When the pizza man brought our pizza to the door.. there were no wings, when we asked about the wings he got flustered and said he didn\\'t know what we were talking about.. after much back and forth he went to his car where low and behold, he found the wings... so shady! But wait, it gets even more shady. As mentioned earlier, the tip was already included in the FINAL total and this delivery guy took it upon himself to add an EXTRA $5 to our bill for his tip! Are you kidding me?! We were starving and irritated and he totally ruined our mood so we didn\\'t bother to argue.\\n\\nHope you enjoy that extra, undeserved tip because you won\\'t be getting business from us or our friends again. First and last time ordering from this place.\\n\\nIf you do an online order.. be careful and watch out for \"TIP-STEALING-TONY\".', \"Love love love the food, always amazing and surprising! The atmosphere isn't very inviting though, but this didn't matter though to stop me from coming back, but the one thing that has turned me off of coming back since happening is that once I called to place an order for my boyfriend to pick up and the person taking the order made me super uncomfortable with the way he told me that he knows who I am and knows my first and last name...I was SO uncomfortable and made this pretty clear, then he told me he could see it on the call display (this prompted me to call my service provider and have them change the name that shows when I call others).

The actual setting is outdated but that is on the outside. When you actually order the service itself is good, though a bit slow at times, and the pizza is the star of the show. I generally go with the classic, such as a pepperoni mushroom bacon, but whatever you do do not ask for extra cheese! When you get your pizza you will understand why - They put on a lot of cheese and that is just how it is.\\n\\nIn terms of flavour it taste just like a typical fast food pizza, maybe a tad better. It's nothing gourmet which is not a bad thing - sometimes you just need a downright dirty pizza and if that's the case this is a great option for you.

The pizza is the best I've had in this area and the wings get in a three way tie with The Portly Piper and Magwyers. Also we had plenty of leftovers for the next day. Bonus!\", \"Was blown away by service - which isn't a small feat when you were just picking up food! \\nDeep dish, NY style pizza just loaded with cheese.\\nPizza is delicious, ingredients are fresh and it really is heads and shoulders above your every day delivery.\\n\\nThe only downside for me, and it was a complete personal taste thing, is that I don't like that much cheese on my pizza and prefer slightly thinner crust. \\n\\nYes, expecting your total outrage at the above comment!! :P\", 'I ordered a meat lovers pizza and it was really good. The pizza has a generous amount of tasty toppings and cheese with the right amount of sauce. The dough is light,soft and crispy around the edges. I will definitely come back for more pizza.', \"Fantastic pizza, altho they cover the toppings in cheese which I don't prefer, but it's not a big issue. We live around the corner so it's convenient for pickup, we haven't used the delivery service. It's pricier tho, so we don't order here often. Great pizza, the wings are good, if you show up too early and have a long wait they serve beer. Thumbs up.\", \"Twice in one week. Spivak!!! And a cold Canadian draft with the wife and her veggie with feta\\n\\nHit by a cheese tsunami and superb service. Highly recommend Pinos. Yes, hard to see from road but Ajax's hidden gem.\\n\\nHaving Pinos pesto pizza and Spivak special. Tell you more after we eat.\", \"Love love love this place- one of the best pizzas I've ever had, great prices, so freaking good. LOVE the toppings and the mountain of cheese. YUM.\", 'So good! I miss this place. I use to go all the time when I was younger and danced at the nearby dance studio.', 'So, here is my story.  My family and I were visiting from Boston, MA.\\n\\nAfter driving 5 hours from Montreal, we immediately dropped our stuff off at the Airbnb we were staying and went to the Zoo.\\n\\nIt was 7:30pm and we were tired and hungry.  We wanted something fast and decided to order pizza for pick up on our way \"home\".\\n\\nSo, we order 2 large pizzas which came out to about $50 (expensive!)\\n\\nDrive was about 20 mins from the zoo and they told us 25 mins. So, perfect timing.\\n\\nWe get there and my dad goes in to pay and pick it up. they had not made our pizzas.  The lady at the counter told us, she thought it was a prank call and did not put the order it.  So, we had to wait a half hour longer for our pizzas.  Out number had come up on the caller ID and after we had told her we were visiting for the weekend.\\n\\nWe are all a little hangry at this point.  so, basically 1.5 hours later our pizzas were ready.\\n\\nThe pizza was rather disappointing as well.  Just too much and heavy slices.\\n\\nNote to visitors: call from a local number if you want pick up.  Now i am not sure if they would have delivered had we called.', 'Sweet Jesus, Pizza Pino is ahhhmazing!\\n\\nMy review is for a take-out order, so this is more about the food- not so much the service. \\n\\nFirst off, I ordered on a Friday night for a party of 4 and they were pretty prompt in getting our order ready. The price was also very good for what you get.\\n\\nSo, we unboxed the pizza at a friend\\'s house and this was my first Pizza Pino experience. Everyone was hyping about it and they compared the pizza to a lasagna. I was beyond excited when I heard this. I got my first slice and there were just toppings coming out of the piece of pizza. I had a veggie slice so there were green peppers, mushrooms, onions, and tomatoes... and a massive bed of cheese. I bit into it and it was just great. One this that I didn\\'t like were the tomatoes. They were just a bit too \"crunchy\" for a piece of pizza. I thought the tomatoes would\\'ve cooked through a bit more than I thought. Other than that, it was just really good pizza.\\n\\nI couldn\\'t eat more than 2 slices because it was just that packed. I\\'d really give this place a try if you\\'re in the mood for a \"deep dish\".... the dish is pretty deep on this one!', 'Had their pizza a couple of times and the toppings are ridiculous. \\nLittle bit higher than other places', \"Love this place!!! \\n\\nTheir cheese is amazing and they really pile on the toppings so if you're not used to it or it's not your thing then try to be minimal with your topping selection.   I learned not to order ground beef on my pizza because it's just too much but I really enjoy a simple pizza from them because the ingredients are fresh and tasty. \\n\\nThe colonel's pizza (ranch dressing instead of sauce with strips of chicken .. ) is really an amazing pizza,. Once I accidentally received this pizza as mine was mixed up with another person's order but I gotta say it was amazing and I never would have ordered something like this myself, so thank you!\", 'If you like thick hardy pizza towered with toppings this is the place for you! Good bang for your buck and some unique topping and sauce choices', \"Great pizza .. very filling quick service ... I always order these guys through the Livery and I must say there is not one person in my home that has not complemented pizza. Each piece of sliced must weigh at least 5 lb LOL you definitely get your money's worth from this establishment the very courteous and timely I have never had an issue with it and I know numerous people that order from this company and they are fabulous.\", 'Disclaimer - I came here for dinner on Labour Day, so this review is based on a restaurant that was very likely understaffed. \\n\\nThis place was close to the waterfront park so my boyfriend and I thought it would be a good idea to try out the thick crust that has gotten great reviews. Here\\'s my take:\\n\\nService (1/5): 1 of the 2 main reasons why I wouldn\\'t come back. I knew we had to wait \"longer\" than usual, but good service would have warned us that we\\'d have to wait around 1 hour for food... We waited 50 minutes for pizza, 55 minutes for poutine. Sure our waitress was kind, and we were thanked for our patience, but it was too late at that point. We just wanted to get something in our stomach and leave.\\n\\nLarge Pino Special + Poutine (1.5/5): The 2nd reason why I wouldn\\'t come back. You can read every other review about how cheesy and full of ingredients the pizza was. How the crust was great and overall for a mom and pop shop they did make good pizza... but that won\\'t make up for the food poisoning my boyfriend and I paid for after the fact. We both thought it was something else, but after I brought home left overs for my family they also had to use the bathroom to get rid of what they ate. I figure it was because Pino\\'s was understaffed and with an influx of orders they rushed and did not cook the pizza well enough. The Poutine was pretty standard, nothing much to say there. \\n\\nCost (3/5): $20 for a large pizza and $7 for poutine + tip. Not bad. It\\'s not a chain, the servings were large and hearty, so I think it was fairly priced.\\n\\nAmbiance (3/5): It\\'s a mom and pop shop! Don\\'t expect anything fancy. However it\\'s family friendly and clean. Can\\'t really ask for more than that.\\n\\nOverall, besides some kind of food poisoning and horrendous wait time, the pizza wasn\\'t that special. it was a nice change from chains like pizza pizza and pizza hut, but not special enough to come back for a second round. Sorry Pino\\'s.', \"Ever since moving to Toronto 16 years ago, and more recently Whitby 12 years ago finding good pizza has been a challenge. Tired of all the franchise brands poor excuse for pizza. We stumbled across this place while searching Yelp. A couple photos of their pizza looked great, and got me excited. So we made the drive to South Ajax to give them a try. While it wasn't the Cornwall pizza I grew up with. It was it's own.. great sauce, fresh toppings and it was very good overall. My daughter had a XS cheese pizza for like $5.31 (so cheap), and my wife and I split a Med (half Pino Special, half Meat Lovers). I was very pleasantly surprised. Very generous on the toppings, including cheese. We will most certainly be back, and want to try other menu items. They had a large number of specialty pizzas.  Want to try their meat sauce base next time. Their location is not really something you will stumble across, so Yelp was a big help to draw us there. The restaurant while clean, is basic and somewhat dated. They were fairly busy for sit down service, but very busy for pick up / take out service. Looking forward to our next visit already.\", \"I needed to update my rating.  During takeout I really just focus on the food quality and taste.  I ordered a large 3 topping with wings special and I was so disappointed they didn't even start making my wings until I got there 30+ minutes later.  they had me and my pizza (now cold) sit for 20 minutes for he wings.  I didn't drive out there to get a very cold pizza; it is really unacceptable they didn't have the wings started when while there was traffic they were not busy.    When I got home they actually put too much cheese on (and I LOVE cheese) so much so the pizza didn't cook properly and the brick of cheese on top fell off when u try to eat it and topping were cold.   The mistake was so bad I really can't justify going out there if they can't serve hot food or get a simple order ready in reasonable time.   I won't be back\", 'Good pizza  bit slow pick up service... good old pizza made almost Montreal style never had a bad pizza from there been around forever delivery service is reliable decent sized menu. Staff were friendly enough very busy kitchen no time to really chat with customers', \"This is such a hidden gem. The pizza I had was veggie and it was amazing. It's how pizza should always taste. The crust was perfect and the amount of toppings you get is worth the money. Even that, the price wasn't too bad. Overall a really nice place.\", \"I absolutely love this place. My go to joint for a special night of pizza. I have definitely made a trip out to Ajax just to get my hands on their calzones and to introduce others to this joint. The place doesn't look very posh from the outside so a city folk may be hesitant to walk in. The location is a bit odd but since I was introduced to it by a local, I've been introducing it to plenty of other people who don't even live in the area. I suggest giving their pizzas and calzones a try. But don't eat with your eyes! Their portions are BIG! I typically cannot finish off a personal calzone and if I do, I'm out cold afterwards.\", 'Best pizza I have ever had in the whole of GTA.... Their crust is soft and the pizza is rich and flavorful... Their cheese is very rich and each pizza is unique', \"My husband and I moved to Toronto about 4 years ago and were struggling to find even a decent pizza place. We stumbled upon Pino Pizza last month when my in-laws were visiting and we were in Oshawa. We yelp'd it and took a chance. No looking back! The pizza is awesome, portions amazing and just overall amazing! It's so unassuming when you see it (it's kind of hidden). I can call it a hidden gem!\", 'Just had the Pizza Pino Special but asked for thin crust.  My new favourite thing you gotta try it', 'Ordered for pick up on a Wednesday night after work.  Our order was ready on time and was waiting when we arrived.  We ordered a large 3 topping pizza.  Pepperoni, mushrooms and sausage.  The pizza was loaded with toppings under the cheese.  The cheese was plentiful and honestly a bit too much for my liking.  I am also not a huge fan of toppings under the cheese.  The crust was also a bit too thick for my taste.  Overall,  it was decent pizza but a bit pricey.  Just not quite what we are used to.  May go back to try their other dishes at some point.', \"Best pizza ever (well, in the GTA anyway).\\nGreat crust, sauce, and toppings. \\n\\nGreat for takeout. We don't live in Ajax, so delivery is unfortunately not an option.\\n\\nEat in is ok- atmosphere is like a small town diner without boothes -  but you go here for the pizza, not the decor. The pizza more than offsets it though. \\n\\nHighly recommend it.\", 'My friend and I stopped to have some good food.  We were not let down.  I had a panzerotti and my friend had spaghetti and meatballs. We also split an order of garlic bread with cheese.  I could only eat a third of it as it was HUGE.  The garlic bread was seasoned just right and had a pile of cheese on it.  Her spaghetti sauce was meaty and full of meatballs.  Definitely will be back again soon!!!', \"I have had Pizza Pino three times so far, and it's really amazing. One time, I ordered a Large and shared it with one other friend, we finally ended up finishing it within a week! (Meat Lover).\\n\\nThere are a LOT of cheese on there, so if you're a cheese lover, this is definitely your kind of pizza! I used to add extra cheese on my pizza everywhere else, but the regular Pino's cheese was a good amount for me already.\\n\\nI would definitely recommend this for big groups, smaller groups (for two people etc.) maybe a small/medium would do.\\n\\nHighly recommend.\", \"Great pizza. Love the mounds of cheese piled on top. Had the Meat Lovers and Pino Special. Loved them both.\\nHave also tried the calzones. I was feeling adventurous and got The Monster. The thing was  ridiculously big! Only got through about a quarter of it. It was good...not great. \\nLastly, I also tried the wings. Now these, I was pleasantly surprised with! When I got the wings and noticed they weren't breaded, I didn't expect much. To my surprise, they were awesome! Nice size and very yummy. They tasted like actual chicken!\\nPizza Pinos really is a hidden gem.\", \"I just went to pizza Pinots tonight after hearing about from my many friends and coworkers and all I have to say is it was worth the wait. i've tried all the generic pizza places like Domino's ,Pizza pizza pizza nova, and Pizza Hut. But this pizza  is made with really good ingredients and great cheeses. But most of all the dough is very edible. So if you live around the East end I encourage you to deafly swing by and grab yourself a pizza.\", 'Best pizza around. The Pino special is the best. The medium is enough for 2 people! The decor is very basic, but the staff is friendly and the food is really good.', \"Cancel your order everywhere else. This is the place for pizza. Makes the others taste like microwave pizza. Toppings a plenty and very generous. Great old school restaurant, like travelling back in time. Can't wait to visit again. Also order in all the time. Just as good at home. Great value, great time.\", \"Came out with a few friends for a birthday dinner. First of all the food was phenomenal - I would highly recommend the garlic bread, wings, onion rings, and especially THE PIZZA. What really made this experience amazing however was our waiter. He checked in on us all night, played music that we enjoyed, and even threw in a complimentary dessert (I've attached a photo)! This is what you call service - and for that reason I will be returning to Pizza Pinos.\", 'We really need to call this something besides pizza. It is the most amazing pizza we\\'ve had. \\n\\nWe\\'ve lived in Ajax for 15 years and have only recently discovered this place. The scope of review for us is limited as we\\'ve only had pizza there despite their other items. \\n\\nThe pizza is amazing. The crust is thick BUT very light. We had the 3 meat variety each time with differing choices. Absolutely delicious. \\n\\nThe surroundings are very un-modern, sparse even hut I can\\'t remove star for that as it seems to add to that neighbourhood independent hand made \"pizza place\" we all remember as kids. \\n\\nThe staff are friendly and easy to deal with. \\n\\nIt\\'s about 30 bucks for a 3 topping XL and it takes about 30 minutes to get it. It\\'s very thick with enough cheese that you\\'ll never want to order extra. The filling is thick, the sauce home made and tasty buy not dominant. \\n\\nIt\\'s been an excellent and consistent experience every time. None of us can imagine ever eating a chain pizza again.', \"The pizza is delicious. Very cheesy & thick, so don't get thick crust or extra cheese. You will probably need a fork and knife to eat it. The cinnamon balls are really good too, you have to get them!\", \"Four-and-a-half. ****'\\n\\nWhat a glorious pie. I only tried two varieties of pizza here and have not explored other menu options. But wow do I wish I had this in college on those nights where a bunch of us were seized with a case of drunken-haze munchies. This would have definitely hit the spot.\\n\\nI had two slice of their small delivered to a friend's house. I enjoyed it so much it warranted an order of their namesake special in the medium the very next day. The crust is on the thin side, but is sturdy and does not fold. It has a nice texture with a good balance of give and a bit of crunch, able to support the toppings. Sauce is well immersed into the pie, without squirting or bleeding out on a bite and without the offending tartness of sauces on pizzas of lesser joints. But the CHEESE. If you don't like cheese, don't bother coming here. I suspect---but I could be wrong--- that there are two layers of cheese: one thin one to anneal the toppings to the pie and another thicker wave that is in direct exposure to the oven heat (leading to spots of caramelized cheese at the topmost layer). The result? A wonderful pie layered in both texture and flavour leading to a more dimensional mouthfeel. Really my only gripe with this pizza is the pepperoni--- I'm a sucker for curled in crispy pepperoni and that can only happen if the pepperoni is at the very top layer. Otherwise, Pizza Pino comes highly recommended.\", 'Always our go to Pizza place in Ajax, love the Pono Special, so much cheese and very filling!', \"Looking for REAL pizza? This is DEFINITELY the place!!! The pizzas are loaded with toppings and cooked to perfection. The wings are perfectly crispy and big. And don't ever forget to order the Pino sticks! Every bite is heavenly.\", \"I decided to try a pizza place that I have heard, time and time again, is the best in Durham Region.  I have had amazing pizza in Little Italy in downtown Toronto and this is not that. However, if you compare the quality of this pizza to the chains available in Durham this place wins hands down. The regular crust is halfway between regular and deep dish. I am a crust and dough lover so it really appealed to me. The flavor of the dough was also great and not overpowered by the rest of the pizza. It was crisp around the edges and bottom and had a great soft chew throughout the rest.  The cheese could be a bit better quality but you can't argue with the amount that they put on. The toppings were also used in good amounts. I had the personal size XS which was under $10 with 3 toppings.  I ate the whole thing and I was STUFFED. The decor is very dated but I personally think that only adds to experience. Add 10 Bikers or 10 Brooklyn accented Italians and you would think that money is being laundered in the back room behind the drapes. Definitely going back here. Not the best pizza I have ever had BUT definitely the best pizza in Durham.\", 'After much anticipation, we finally had a chance to sample what other Yelpers voted as \"the best pizza in Durham region.\"  As much as I value fellow Yelper\\'s opinions, I was still skeptical coming from some disagreeable experiences from previous Yelp recommendations.  \\n\\nWe drove into this very nondescript plaza on a lazy Saturday afternoon looking for lunch.  We were greeted and seated promptly by a very efficient young server who was also our pizza maker.  Since it was our first time, we decided to stick to something \"safe\" like a medium size pizza (Pino Special, I think) and a Caesar salad to share between the two of us.  \\n\\nWhat first came out was a huge mound of over-dressed romaine in store bought dressing with a very generous amount of house-made croutons and enough bacon bits (the real thing) to clog a grown man\\'s artery!   To be fair, I have to mention that we were given an option of receiving our salad tossed or with the dressing on the side.  And since we opted for the salad to be tossed in the kitchen, we can\\'t really complain about the dressing overload part.  But let me just say that my husband is a real bacon lover and even he proceeded to push extra bacon bits he couldn\\'t consume to the side of his plate which by the end of our belly-busting meal, created a small tower.  The salad was so huge that by the time our pizza arrived, we were already pretty full.  \\n\\nAnd then the behemoth of a pizza was placed on our table.....and we just looked at each other and burst into laughter at the thickness of this thing.  We had read numerous reviews about pizza pino\\'s pizza being thick crust but seriously....this was like having two regular pizzas (like what you\\'ll get from pizza pizza) stacked on top of each other.  Again, not necessarily a bad thing for those wanting a hefty meal but for us, it was supposed to be lunch.  \\n\\nOur pizza was LOADED with pepperoni slices, mushrooms, even more bacon bits, I think there were some green peppers and soooooooooo much cheese.  I can\\'t even begin to describe what this thing looked like.  (please refer to the photos)  I had ONE slice and could not dare grab another one.  My stout hubby had impressive TWO slices.  The shock of the thickness aside, the pizza was tasty.  How could it not be with that much goodness???  It\\'s just a shame that we were so full from our salad.  We packed up the rest (more than half of the medium pizza) for dinner.  We ended up eating the leftovers over 2 meals!\\n\\nNow, the million dollar question is, would I return to Pizza Pino.  I think I might....that is if I could recruit enough heavy eaters to justify ordering a pizza that big (or that thick).', \"We finally tried this place after wanting to for a long time! We were not disappointed. Friendly staff. It's not in the best location as it is out of the way, but the pizza is delicious! I love a pizza with the perfect ratio of cheese, dough and toppings and they definitely had that. We had their Spivak special with pepperoni, bacon, sausage and pineapple. Their small size looked like a medium-sized pizza!\\nWhile you wait for your pizza, you can have a beer on draught or any other alcoholic beverage since they are licensed to serve alcohol.\", \"Great pizza!! I order the Meat Lovers and the Pino special.... I recommend the Pino special.   Pizzas were cooked nicely and had the right amount of toppings.   The Pizzas were very filling.   I'm off to try the monster panz....will write a review about it\", \"A unique pizza experience!\\n\\nI love dining in retro places, particularly the retro places which are kept clean and this is one of those.\\n\\nYou would walk in and first thing you would notice is that they have classical 70-80s songs playing, you walk a little further and see that all the walls in this place are occupied by photos of historical Ajax. Since I have literally moved to Ajax 2 days ago, i got to learn a lot about Ajax's history through this! cool.\\n\\nWe ordered a deal of 1 medium pizza and 10 wings, added 3 extra toppings to the pizza and the bill just came up to $30, very reasonable!\\n\\nNow the pizza they have is very different than your normal day to day pizza, they do thick crusts, but unlike other pizza joints, they aren't stingy with their toppings and cheese. SOOO MUCH CHEESSE! and its high quality too. The grilled chicken on the pizza had flavour as well.\\n\\nThe wings were cooked good and the blue cheese with it went perfectly, but the hot flavour is just frank sauce all over it.\\n\\nWould definitely be coming back here.\\n\\nNote: It does take a little while for them to make the pizza.\", 'Love this pizza shop.  The pies have so much cheese on them and they have a bunch of ingredients on hand to customize.  I wish the price was a little less tho', \"Recently moved into the area and I've already had pizza from here half dozen times. Everyone that I know that I've given pizza to has said they need to open more locations. \\n\\nThe pizza reminds me of deep dish pizza. It's not too doughy like Pizza Pizza pizza but not too thin. It's just right! Having the cheese on top is genius! The toppings won't slide off like other places.\\n\\nThe wings are also very good. Not too small or big with a good amount of meat on them. The recommendation of honey garlic and hot sauce was one of the best flavours I've had.\\n\\nStaff is always courteous and efficient. Only thing I can complain about is that the pizza can't come fast enough!! I need it now!!! Sooooooo good and worth the wait!\", 'Great food! Great staff!\\n\\nWalking into the restaurant, felt like a small town lounge spot, with a couple dozen people talking, and playing cards.\\n\\nI was reading through yelp reviews before deciding to drive to Ajax from Scarborough for pizza and i saw a photo with the comment: \"two adults could not even finish a medium 10\" pizza\". Being skeptical, and very hungry i decided to try this place out with a friend.\\n\\nSpecial: large 1 toping for just under $11.\\n\\nThat pizza was split between two hungry 20 year old guys. It was one of the best (and cheapest) pizza i have had.\\n\\nThere was only one toping, but plenty of it, and the cheese and sauce were plentiful also very good. \\n\\nDefinitely plan on going back.', \"Amazing pizza, very filling. A couple slices os heavy. Unique combinations. Can't wait to try again\", 'easily my favourite pizza joint in Ontario.  nice thick crust, plenty of fresh toppings and cheese to give it that wow factor.', \"This place doesn't seem like much, but if you want pizza that is hearty and eats like a meal this is the place. After eating this pizza i was stuffed, the toppings are generous.\\n\\nThis place is good for takeout, i personally would not want dine there as the place is kinda suspect. I felt like i was transported back to an old 80's bar.\\n\\nBut to each his own :)\", 'After reading the reviews, we decided to come here for our first dinner after arriving in Canada. We ordered the small veggie pizza which was pretty good. It was very doughy and kind of reminded me of Pizza Hut pizza. We also ordered the pasta with meat sauce and mushrooms and liked it. This dish brought back memories of my dad.  :). We also ordered poutines which were ok. The french fries w Service was very friendly. Glad we stopped by!', 'This is the best pizza I have had between markham and oshawa. It has a crispy bottom and soft dough with lots of topping. My boyfriend and I split a medium and still have almost half a pizza left over. We will be coming back. Great server too.', \"This is a great little spot. The price is similar to that of big chains, like Dominos and Pizza Hut but the quality of the ingredients and that thick crust homemade goodness can't be beat. The service was good, definitely not the greatest I've ever encountered but they get the job done. We ordered pizza, wings and drinks. Excellent pizza and passable wings. This place is a little bit off the beaten track and isn't somewhere I'd necessarily go out of my way to find again. \\n\\nCheck it out if you're around. You won't regret it.\", \"Thick slices with amazing sauce and tons of cheese. Salads are fresh and plentiful. They do lots of take out business for the locals. Worth the diversion if you're ever heading down the 401 east of Toronto!\", 'Cue music: \"She was a one-fork, one-knife, shrewd Pretentious Pizza Eater...\"\\nHate to crash the 5-star pizza party here, buuut... pizza is a personal thing, and personally, Pizza Pino\\'s isn\\'t my favourite. They do the thick crust with generous toppings style well, but if you prefer thinner crust and more modest amounts of cheese, specify that when you order.\\n\\nWhat I liked: dough was well cooked although it was thick; toppings were generous.\\n\\nWhat I didn\\'t like: personal taste again, but the sauce is a specific brand used at some pizza places that has a bitterness to it, and they\\'re a bit heavy-handed for my liking; their usual amount of cheese is A LOT of cheese, so it doesn\\'t melt into the other toppings but instead kinda lays on top like a stretchy blanket. Overall it\\'s just too heavy.\\n\\nI will be back to try thinner crust and all that but in summary, know that you\\'re getting good North American-style pizza here. For anything else, go somewhere else.', 'My brother told me about this place. Seems the local tradesmen are \"big fans.\"\\nHeard stories of the \"monster panzerotti.\"\\n\\nDecided I would try this place out. I\\'ve only ever has the \"monster panzerotti\" and I\\'ve only ever had take out. And I can say that everyone who\\'s tried Pizza Pino with me has loved it.\\n\\nI get bacon,mushroom, and sausage and it will easily feed three guys with a generous portion.\\n\\nThe panzo comes in at about $20 off memory, so more than your typical fast food joint. But I would say the quality is worth the price.\\n\\nIf your in the area check it out.', 'AMAZING PIZAA!!!! love this place and very reasonable price', 'Best pizza in Durham bar none!  I prefer thick crust pizza loaded with lots of toppings, but unfortunately nobody does Chicago style here... Pizza Pino is more like Buffalo style, which is a New York/Chicago hybrid.  Lots of toppings, thick crust.  It\\'s not significantly more expensive than chain pizza but blows them all away in quality. What was really telling is, \"extra\" or \"double\" cheese is not offered as an option. You won\\'t need it....\\n\\nIf you\\'re tired of GTA chain pizza where the sauce and cheese are applied with a spray gun, but are also not a fan of thin crust so-called \"gourmet\" hype with stupid toppings (I hate that CPK-style crap), try Pino\\'s.  Driving to Ajax is a lot cheaper than travelling to New York or Chicago!', \"First time got delivery . Took a hour but was worth it . Pizza was great after eating 5 wings I could only eat a peice and a half I was so full . Lol I'm stuffed but it was amazing! \\nI got the wh wh crust as we eat clean . To me was a bit bitter tasting so I'd get reg next time maybe.  Definatly a amazing Montreal style pizza. Wings are also big and fresh .\", 'Amazing Amazing Amazing tasting pizzas!! they do not skimp on any of the toppings. they create mouthwatering masterpieces. I have tried many of their pizzas and they always tasted great. best place to get pizza in Durham region and GTA.', \"I tried this because of yelp reviews and boy am I glad I did.  I'm a pizza fiend; this place loads up so much topping and so much cheese..I can't imagine what would happen if u ordered extra cheese.  Wings are fantastic...I'm going to have to adjust my rating for other pizza places because while good..it's not Pizza Pino.  I drive from bowmanville on Sundays and am never disappointed.\", \"Don't come to Pizza Pino unless you're famished. Not only is the food delicious but the servings are more than most people can eat in one sitting. It is a bit cozy inside but that adds to the restaurant's unique atmosphere.\", 'Great pizza .. Fluffy not oily. Very friendly service. Had the large 3 topping pizza and 1lbs wings fed 3 people. Very delicious :D', 'I was very impressed with the food here. The pizzas are fantastic, and much bigger than their name suggests. Although I only ordered a \"small\" I still took a couple of slices home. Prices are fair for a restaurant, a little higher than typically found at a chain delivery store, but in my opinion are worth it.\\n\\nThe crust is a good balance between being not too thin, nor too thick or stodgy. The sauce and cheese is plenty, and toppings aren\\'t stingily laid.\\n\\nStaff were friendly, not too intrusive, but aware enough of when drinks needed topping up, and to bring take home boxes. I was also grateful that they put a rush on my autistic son\\'s order, as he has a very hard time in restaurants waiting for his food to come out once ordered. The rest of our table\\'s order took a bit of while, but was worth the wait. This was my first visit, but I will certainly be back.', 'This place had really outstanding pizza. we would pay $7 for delivery. Over th,e past six months the delivery has been really bad, pizza cold and salad dressing forgotten. Last night was my last try at it.', \"Service was amazing, without a doubt. We got the large pizza and wings combo with the pino sticks to start. The pino sticks were great and the hot wings were great too. But I am probably the only person on this page who didn't like the pizza. Far too much cheese, crust is way too thick, and we just didn't enjoy it. That being said, my husband had their panzerotti a few weeks ago and loved it. I would go back, but only for the pino sticks or a panzerotti.\", 'Service and food quality has declined drastically. Third time our order has been messed up and or food has been poor quality. Will never order from there again', 'one of the best Pizza places I know of. Thick crust. Tons of cheese. Large portions, keep your order small.', 'Durham regions best pizza.  Everything was right, the ambiance is what you expect a pizza place to be, the crust was perfect, the ingredients were fresh, the wait was not too bad and the service was friendly.  The four of us shared a pie, no rush, we chatted, and left satisfied.  This is a great place to meet with old friends and get reacquainted', 'In town for the weekend, and chose Pino Pizza because of the reviews on yelp. \\nVery good and cheesy.', 'Delicious pizza, especially if you like thick crust. All of the pizzas are awesome, even just plain cheese or peperoni. Definitely give it a try if you are in the area!', \"Always great pizza, generous toppings and cooked well! The staff and delivery driver seem to always be in a good mood. If you like panzerotti's try the Monster :)\", \"One word for this restaurant - CHEESE! And Lots of it! It's a bit pricy for pizza - many other places in the area (eg. chain stores) will have better deals, but not better taste than Pizza Pino!\", \"Pizza Pino has the best Pizza I've found in Durham Region.  You can tell when you bite into it that it's fresh and hand made.  The crust is delicious and the toppings are generous.  The pizza is quite filling so keep that in mind when ordering as you may normally order an extra large from a chain place, you may only need a large from Pizza Pino.  I ordered the wings recently and they were quite good.  Big, Juicy and Saucy.  I was surprised at the quality of the wings as usually from pizza places they aren't very good.   \\n\\nPizza Pino's does take longer to deliver/pickup than chain restaurants but it's well worth it.  Try their walk-in special, it's quite reasonable considering what you get.\", \"Calling all LACTOSE INTOLERANT YELPERS - This is NOT the place for you.\\n\\nIf you love cheese then welcome to Pizza Pino's! \\n\\nI wish this place would do a reno.  It's a complete mess inside - you wouldn't want to stay and eat here.  It belongs on the show restaurant makeover, however don't be fooled - It doesn't reflect the quality of food.\\nOn the website it looks better than what it really is.  They claim they are a sports bar - I beg to differ.   I came in here on a Wednesday night and it was DEAD.  A lot of people preorder and get takeout. \\n\\nI found this place hard to find too, it's tucked away near factory buildings and totally isolated. \\n\\nBack to the food: \\n\\nSo I got the Pino's special which was pepperoni, peppers, mushrooms and I believe bacon? Can't recall now.\\n\\nThis place does their pizza the opposite way - the toppings are hidden under the brick of cheese they use.... seriously we are talking A LOT of cheese. Food is hot and a med size will feed 2 people with a few leftover slices for lunch the next day. \\n\\nStaff are friendly - a lot of their customers are regulars so they say hi and catch up on old convos - kinda of like a family unit in there.\\n\\nIf you ever have a pizza craving in Ajax - Head to Pino's!\", \"Pino's is the only place my family of 10 can agree on for take out. They get the orders right and everything is hot and fresh. The pile on the toppings and cheese to the point where it seems it is 3 times as much as any other pizza place. You get great value for your money here!\", \"Great pizza. Tons of cheese and fresh toppings. The crust is excellent. They have reasonable liquor prices. The pizza is very filling, after 3 slices you're stuffed.\", 'Pizza was OK and generous with cheese - had half spivak and half pino. Pino had meat that seemed overcooked, but the spivak was fine. Server was very nice. However we waited 45 minutes for the pizza to finally arrive.', \"The most flavorful thick crust pizza in the Toronto area by far!!!!\\n\\nI usually like thin crust authentic pizzas. Lombardi's in New York is my all time favorite but this place has reshaped my thoughts on thick crust. Each slice is heavily topped and has the perfect amount of flavor and although the amount of toppings are ridiculous, the crust holds up great. I can't stress enough how tasty these things are. Amazing!\\n\\nIf ever in the Ajax area you MUST pick up a pizza here. Take it home and re-heat it, its still amazing even 2 days after. A must try!\", 'One word: WOW! And not just \"wow\", we\\'re talking \"WOW!\" I wish I could just leave it at that but that probably won\\'t do. Pizza Pino is a treasure that my friends and I came across while visiting another friend in Ajax. They serve pizza, pasta, salad, yummy fried goodness, all the good stuff. You can add a variety of toppings but they have set prices for set toppings, such as the meat lovers, or veggie pizza. Their pizza is similar to Chicago pizza for those who\\'ve tried, but thinner crust.\\n\\nThe thing I love about this place is how fresh their toppings are; the chicken chunks are huge and tender, unlike other franchise pizza joints that have meats as hard as wood. And for the cheese lovers, you don\\'t even have to worry about getting extra cheese because the amount of cheese you get on your pizza is ridiculously thick. Pino definitely does not cheap out on their toppings. \\n\\nWe ordered a large that on their website claimed to feed 3-4 people, but even with four hungry stomachs there were at least a quarter left of the pizza by the end of our feast. I\\'d say a large easily feeds 4-5! I ordered a medium on my own, and that alone was more than enough for my family of four for dinner!\\n\\nIt\\'s pricey though, and that large pizza came up to $40, the medium $20. Granted, we customized our own pizza so it went by a different price. There was also a 45 minute wait on delivery, where it usually takes half the time (or so I\\'m told) so be prepared to wait for your food! Or call in ahead of time. But I definitely recommend this place to anyone who is a pizza lover. \\n\\n10/10 would come again!', 'I\\'m not a fan of thick crust pizza...but I make an exception when it comes to Pizza Pino. \\nThe best pizza ever! Tons of cheese and toppings. I\\'m just drooling thinking about the \"Pino\\'s Special\" right now!!!!', \"Delicious deep dish pizza! We order a small (or Medium if extra hungry) Pino's Special for two of us and ask for it to be well-cooked.\", 'I LOVE this pizza joint and eat here religiously. They load up the toppings and cheese, and its so thick you need a fork and a knife to cut into it. \\n\\nI have not rewarded them another star simply because the service is a hit and miss. One specific waitress here was very condescending when my family attended the place a year and a half ago.', \"Best pizza I've eaten.  Thick,  generous amounts of toppings and cheese.  A tad expensive but definitely worth the price\", \"Ordered from here for the first time after reading the reviews and I must say they hold up well. Some people complained about time service,  but I don't have a single complaint I ordered my pizza and within 1hr it was delivered. Which brings me to another service I'm happy with, I live in Whitby and very surprised they deliver this far and especially with the 1hr ordering and at my door and time frame. \\n\\nAs far as the food goes. I loved the pizza and the pino sticks were not bad nothing super special. I find the pino sticks had too much garlic on the top. Now the pizza was amazing, it wasn't as thick as other pictures posted but maybe that is because I got the garlic based pizza. I had pizza once at chucky cheese and liked how it had a garlic base so when I seen these guys offered it I had to try it out. Definitely awesome and adds more flavor to the pizza while not being over powering the toppings. I just had a 2 cheese and pepporoni and I could still them both. So A+ on the pizza!!!\\n\\nNow it was $30 for a medium pizza and sticks so not too bad and well worth the extra little cost. I will definitely order from them again. I like trying all these one off pizza places they always seem to be better then the big name stores. \\n\\nI'd definitely recommend this place. I give it 4.5/5 but the application will not let me so 5 it is. Just due to the pino stick.\", \"More a 4.5\\nThis is an overall score.\\nWe ordered in, did an xlarge pizza not knowing what we were getting ourselves into lol. Also 2 lbs of bbq wings. So the wings I wasnt a fan of. The bbq sauce was tasty but the wings were pretty dry as though they were cooked a few minutes too long. So thats where tge extra stars come off.\\nThe pizza on the other hand.\\nOut of this world, best I've ever had hands down. The crust is perfectly cooked almost as though they have a wood oven. The toppings they do not skimp at all. We almost got extra cheese since most places you have to. Thank god we didnt because it was beautifully dressed. Red onions on the bottom, pepperoni, real bacon and the cheese . So much cheese I was in heaven. One slice is like 3 slices from other pizza joints. So filling and mouth watering. I am from missisauga but let me twll you I am so willing to travel for my new found love. \\nDont second guess just get it!!! *licks lips*\", 'The pizza tastes great and the ingredients are excellent but the service and the restaurant atmosphere are pretty terrible. \\nThe 1st time we went there we waited a very long time and after half an hour we were told they forgot to input our order and we had to wait another half hour for our pizzas.  The 2nd time we went  they brought one pizza and forgot our second order ( sandwich and fries). By the time they realized it , my husband and son were done eating their pizza and i was still starving and just really upset that I wanted to leave (by the way the fries are quite a disappointment) . When we complained they didn\\'t offer any apologies and just said that the kitchen is backed up on \"non-pizza\" orders and they can\\'t manage it so that all orders come to the table at the same time!\\nBoth times the place was very poorly ventilated and smelled like burnt grease.\\nI might consider pick-up in the future  because my family really loved the pizza but I would never go eat there again.', 'I find Pizza Pino somewhat deceptive, they put the cheese on top which covers how few of the other items they actually put on the pizza.', \"Huge pizza, but pretty slim on the toppings I felt.  I came all the way from Oshawa to try this pizza out.\\n\\nPerhaps Friday night was an off night, because the XL Pino Special I got was one slim pizza when it came to toppings.  It was pretty reasonable with the cheese, though, but I think I'll just stick to Beenos in Oshawa.  Same style of pizza but probably double the toppings as Pizza Pino.\", \"Great pizza so much cheese can't ask for any thing more. Got the meat lovers very filling great little hidden gem in Durham recommend next time you decide to order a pizza think of pizza pinos first you won't regret it.\", 'Amazing pizza with lots of toppings and cheese! I highly recommend this place to every pizza enthusiast in the GTA.', 'Great pizza! Fully loaded with cheese but not grease at all. Also the crust is very tasty. The atendente was sympathetic but I felt he could had checked on us during the meal. But overall we had a great meal!', 'We really wanted to try their pizza and wings after reading the good reviews. We had family over for my birthday. We are extremely disappointed with the customer service.  We ordered at 5:30. We were told to expect to get the delivery by about 6:30. They are only about five kilometres away in Ajax.  The delivery guy just arrived at 8. It was an hour and a half late. I had called a few times to follow up. They said the delivery person came but no one answered the door; we live in a small home and we would have heard the door bell loud and clear.  Extremely disappointing. We wanted to support local business and this one generally had good reviews.  Wish they would improve their delivery and customer service.  We just ended up cancelling the order.', 'Always on the lookout for new pizza joints in Durham and decided to try this place out because of the rave reviews. Pizza & wings were okay.\\n\\nWe ordered online where the tip and taxes were all included on the final total and that should have been the amount we paid when our pizza arrived, obviously. When the pizza man brought our pizza to the door.. there were no wings, when we asked about the wings he got flustered and said he didn\\'t know what we were talking about.. after much back and forth he went to his car where low and behold, he found the wings... so shady! But wait, it gets even more shady. As mentioned earlier, the tip was already included in the FINAL total and this delivery guy took it upon himself to add an EXTRA $5 to our bill for his tip! Are you kidding me?! We were starving and irritated and he totally ruined our mood so we didn\\'t bother to argue.\\n\\nHope you enjoy that extra, undeserved tip because you won\\'t be getting business from us or our friends again. First and last time ordering from this place.\\n\\nIf you do an online order.. be careful and watch out for \"TIP-STEALING-TONY\".', \"Love love love the food, always amazing and surprising! The atmosphere isn't very inviting though, but this didn't matter though to stop me from coming back, but the one thing that has turned me off of coming back since happening is that once I called to place an order for my boyfriend to pick up and the person taking the order made me super uncomfortable with the way he told me that he knows who I am and knows my first and last name...I was SO uncomfortable and made this pretty clear, then he told me he could see it on the call display (this prompted me to call my service provider and have them change the name that shows when I call others). I haven't called or been back since.\", \"I'm not really a fan. We ordered delivery one evening and the total was about $42 for two pizzas. We live down the street and was told our pizzas would be delivered in 20 mins.\\n\\nWe waited 20 mins... then 30 mins... then an hour...\\n\\nWe eventually called them to find out where our pizzas were. Turns out the delivery guy hasn't even left the shop yet.\\n\\nWe cancelled our order then and there and ordered sushi for dinner instead. What a waste of time.\", \"Great, cheesy Pizza. The place (decor etc), is not the best. However, when it comes to the pizza it was amazing. We got the Canadian (Whole-Wheat crust), and we were pleasantly surprised by the exceptional taste and even though we got a small it was more than enough for two people. Would Highly recommend for pizza in Ajax. As good as it gets for pizza in Ajax! I'm glad we tried it.\", \"If you're absolutely craving a pizza and you were having a bad day, then Pizza Pino is probably where you want to go. \\n\\nThis is a nice family owned restaurant and I remember the first time that I went there I didn't think it was going to be very good. The actual setting is outdated but that is on the outside. When you actually order the service itself is good, though a bit slow at times, and the pizza is the star of the show. I generally go with the classic, such as a pepperoni mushroom bacon, but whatever you do do not ask for extra cheese! When you get your pizza you will understand why - They put on a lot of cheese and that is just how it is.\\n\\nIn terms of flavour it taste just like a typical fast food pizza, maybe a tad better. It's nothing gourmet which is not a bad thing - sometimes you just need a downright dirty pizza and if that's the case this is a great option for you. Just be prepared to throw that 'diet' out the window.\", \"Best Pizza around.\\nFriendly atmosphere!\\nTheir dough is made fresh everyday, so no hard flacky crust like other chain places.\\nDon't ask for extra cheese, they put lots of cheese and toppings!!!\\nAmazing food!\", \"Hands down the best pizza I've have had since moving to Ontario.\\n\\nIn western Canada thick crust pizza is the norm... I had been searching for a suitable replacement since moving....  Thrilled to say I found it!\\n\\nGreat crust, not greasy, tons of quality toppings and lots of cheese!!!\\n\\nOne recommendation... Order to go.   This place is nothing to look at and quite dated inside - the pizza totally impresses... The dining room doesn't.   This was the only thing stopping me from a solid five stars.\", \"Pino's, a fan I am!\\n\\nIf you are looking for a deep dish style pizza loaded with ingredients and a ton of cheese ( I am not shi**ing you) they must use a pound of cheese on the pies they put out !\\nIf you are looking for a real heart stopper, get the panzarotti!\\n(A large pizza loaded folded in half)\\nOMG its deep dish pizza heaven!!!!\\n\\nIf you havent had a deep dish you liked in the past, give this place a try....you'll be a fan.\", 'This place USED to be good many years ago but as of late it is absolutely terrible. The last two times we ordered it took over an hour and a half to arrive and we had to call to literally remind them to bring it because they forgot. When we got our 2 extra large pizzas for the family party, they were completely cold! When we called and asked for a refund they said they cannot do that but we can have a 10$ credit for next time. Unbelievable. There must be new owners or staff because this is not the pizza pino I used to know.', \"Great Pizza!! Especially if you like cheese. Their pizza is loaded with fresh toppings and tons of cheese!! Best Pizza I have had in a long time. Slices are huge, was full after 2 but still ate another because it was so good.  We ate in. They had a little bar in there and a TV with the Winter Olympics on. Staff was friendly. They didn't have a kids menu but were happy to bring us a smaller portion of pasta for my 2 year old and didn't charge full price. Can't wait to go back or order for delivery.\"]\n"
